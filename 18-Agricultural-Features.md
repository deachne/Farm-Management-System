## Agricultural AI Agents

### Field Scout Agent

**Purpose**: Assist with field observations and scouting activities

**Capabilities**:
- Process field photos to identify issues
- Recommend scouting patterns based on field history
- Generate structured observation reports
- Provide real-time identification assistance
- Correlate observations with yield potential

**Example Interaction**:
```
Farmer: "I'm seeing these yellow patches in my corn field."
[Uploads photo]

Field Scout Agent: "I've analyzed your photo and identified nitrogen deficiency 
in your corn at V6 stage. Based on the pattern and your soil type, this is 
likely due to leaching from the heavy rains last week. I recommend tissue 
sampling from both affected and unaffected areas to confirm. Would you like 
me to create a sampling plan?"
```

### Crop Advisor Agent

**Purpose**: Provide recommendations for crop management decisions

**Capabilities**:
- Analyze soil test results
- Generate fertilizer recommendations
- Suggest optimal planting and treatment timing
- Provide variety selection assistance
- Create crop protection strategies

**Example Interaction**:
```
Farmer: "What should I plant in Field 5 next year?"

Crop Advisor Agent: "Based on your rotation history, soil tests, and yield 
data, I recommend planting soybeans in Field 5 next year. Your pH levels 
are optimal for soybeans, and following your corn crop will help break 
disease cycles. Consider varieties with SCN resistance based on your soil 
test results. Would you like specific variety recommendations for your area?"
```

### Equipment Manager Agent

**Purpose**: Assist with equipment maintenance and deployment

**Capabilities**:
- Track maintenance schedules
- Diagnose equipment issues
- Optimize equipment deployment
- Manage parts inventory
- Calculate operational costs

**Example Interaction**:
```
Farmer: "My planter is skipping seeds in row 6."

Equipment Manager Agent: "Based on your description and maintenance history, 
this could be caused by: 1) Worn seed disk, 2) Incorrect vacuum pressure, or 
3) Seed tube obstruction. Your seed disk was last replaced 2 seasons ago, 
which is approaching the recommended replacement interval. I've created a 
troubleshooting checklist and parts list if replacement is needed. Would you 
like me to show you the inspection procedure?"
```

### Market Analyst Agent

**Purpose**: Provide market intelligence and selling recommendations

**Capabilities**:
- Monitor commodity prices
- Analyze market trends
- Generate selling recommendations
- Calculate potential returns
- Assess market risks

**Example Interaction**:
```
Farmer: "Should I sell my remaining corn now or wait?"

Market Analyst Agent: "Based on current market conditions, historical patterns, 
and your storage costs, waiting may be advantageous. December corn futures are 
showing a positive trend, with a potential 5-8% increase over the next 60 days. 
Your calculated storage cost is $0.03/bushel/month, which is outpaced by the 
projected price increase. However, I should note that upcoming USDA reports 
could introduce volatility. Would you like to see a detailed price projection 
chart?"
```
