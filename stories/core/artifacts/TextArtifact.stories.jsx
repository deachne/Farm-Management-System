## Field Summary
- **Field A**: Corn, 45 acres, growth stage V6
- **Field B**: Soybeans, 30 acres, growth stage V3
- **Field C**: Wheat, 25 acres, pre-harvest

## Soil Moisture Analysis
Current readings indicate that Field A is maintaining optimal moisture levels between 45-50%, while Field B has dropped to 30-35% after the recent dry spell. Immediate irrigation is recommended for Field B to prevent yield impact.

## Pest Monitoring
Scout reports indicate low presence of corn rootworm in Field A, below economic threshold. Continue monitoring but no immediate action required. Field B shows early signs of soybean aphids, recommend spot treatment in affected areas only.

## Equipment Status
All tractors and irrigation systems are operational. The John Deere 8R needs scheduled maintenance next week before heavy planting operations begin.

## Recommendations
1. Irrigate Field B within next 48 hours
2. Apply spot treatment for aphids in southeast section of Field B
3. Schedule soil testing for Field C post-harvest
4. Prepare fertilizer plan for next rotation

## Weather Forecast
Expecting 0.5" rainfall on Thursday, followed by rising temperatures (85-90Â°F) over the weekend. Plan fieldwork accordingly.`,
