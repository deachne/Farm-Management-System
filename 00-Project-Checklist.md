# Farm Management System - Project Checklist

This checklist tracks the development progress of our agricultural knowledge management system. Each item includes a brief description and links to relevant documentation files.

## 1. Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)

- [ ] **1.1 Set up AnythingLLM extension framework** - Create extension points for agricultural features
- [ ] **1.2 Implement agricultural notes data model** - Add farm-specific fields to database schema
- [ ] **1.3 Create basic notes UI** - Implement the notes interface shown in mockup
- [ ] **1.4 Develop field mapping component** - Simple visualization of farm fields
- [ ] **1.5 Set up mobile-friendly interface** - Ensure usability in field conditions

## 2. Data Collection (Phase 1)

- [ ] **2.1 Implement voice note capture** - Record and transcribe field observations
- [ ] **2.2 Create structured observation templates** - Templates for common farm observations
- [ ] **2.3 Add location tagging** - Automatically link notes to specific fields
- [ ] **2.4 Develop image capture integration** - Add photos to field observations
- [ ] **2.5 Implement weather data integration** - Add current conditions to observations

## 3. AI Enhancement (Phase 2)

- [ ] **3.1 Extend vectorization for agricultural data** - Optimize embeddings for farm terminology
- [ ] **3.2 Implement agricultural entity extraction** - Identify fields, crops, equipment in text
- [ ] **3.3 Create specialized agricultural agents** - Develop agents for different farming tasks
- [ ] **3.4 Develop context-aware retrieval** - Retrieve information based on seasonal context
- [ ] **3.5 Implement MCP client integration** - Connect to specialized agricultural MCP servers

## 4. Specialized Tools (Phase 2)

- [ ] **4.1 Create soil test analysis tool** - Process and visualize soil test results
- [ ] **4.2 Implement price quote management** - Track and compare input prices
- [ ] **4.3 Develop equipment maintenance tracker** - Monitor maintenance schedules and history
- [ ] **4.4 Create crop planning tool** - Plan rotations and input requirements
- [ ] **4.5 Implement field history visualization** - Show timeline of field activities and observations

## 5. Advanced Features (Phase 3)

- [ ] **5.1 Develop predictive analytics** - Forecast yields and input requirements
- [ ] **5.2 Implement recommendation engine** - Generate actionable recommendations
- [ ] **5.3 Create decision support tools** - Help evaluate options and scenarios
- [ ] **5.4 Develop collaborative features** - Enable team sharing and communication
- [ ] **5.5 Implement comprehensive reporting** - Generate reports for different aspects of farm operations
