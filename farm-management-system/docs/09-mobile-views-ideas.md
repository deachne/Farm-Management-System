# Mobile Views & Features - Future Considerations

## Core Mobile Focus
- Prioritize simple, focused mobile interfaces for field use
- Primary focus on observation capture and journaling
- Keep mobile interface lightweight and offline-capable

## Field Observation Features
1. **Voice-to-Text Observations**
   - Speak observations directly in the field
   - AI processes speech into structured notes
   - Works offline with later sync

2. **Scouting Templates**
   - AI-guided observation prompts
   - Contextual suggestions based on:
     - Crop type
     - Growth stage
     - Season
     - Previous observations
   - Bullet-point checklists for consistent scouting

3. **Smart Journaling**
   - AI assists in structuring verbal notes
   - Converts casual observations into formatted reports
   - Extracts key data points from natural speech

## Future Considerations
- Integration with mobile device sensors (weather, GPS, camera)
- Offline-first architecture for rural areas
- Photo capture with AI analysis
- Voice command interface for hands-free operation
- Quick-entry templates for common observations

## Implementation Notes
- Start with basic observation capture
- Add AI features incrementally
- Test thoroughly in field conditions
- Focus on reliability over feature complexity
