# Phase 2: Document Processing Pipeline

## Overview

The Document Processing Pipeline phase focuses on building a robust system for ingesting, processing, and preparing agricultural documents for vectorization and retrieval. This phase will implement specialized document processors for farm-specific content types, metadata extraction for agricultural entities, and optimized chunking strategies for field reports and technical documentation.

## Objectives

- Create a flexible document processing pipeline architecture
- Implement specialized processors for agricultural document types
- Develop metadata extraction systems for farm entities (fields, crops, equipment)
- Design chunking strategies optimized for agricultural content
- Integrate with AnythingLLM's vectorization system
- Ensure compatibility with LibreChat's document handling

## Components

### 1. Pipeline Architecture

- **DocumentPipeline**: Core pipeline orchestrator
- **PipelineStage**: Interface for pipeline processing stages
- **PipelineContext**: Shared context object for pipeline execution
- **PipelineRegistry**: Registry for available processors and stages

### 2. Core Document Processors

- **TextDocumentProcessor**: Process plain text documents
- **PDFDocumentProcessor**: Process PDF documents with farm-specific extraction
- **ImageDocumentProcessor**: Process images with metadata extraction
- **SoilReportProcessor**: Specialized processor for soil test reports
- **EquipmentManualProcessor**: Specialized processor for equipment manuals
- **FieldObservationProcessor**: Process field observation notes

### 3. Metadata Extraction System

- **MetadataExtractor**: Core metadata extraction interface
- **EntityRecognizer**: Farm entity recognition system
- **LocationExtractor**: Extract and normalize field locations
- **DateTimeNormalizer**: Normalize seasonal and temporal references
- **EquipmentIdentifier**: Identify equipment references in documents

### 4. Chunking Strategies

- **ChunkingStrategy**: Interface for chunking strategies
- **SemanticChunker**: Chunk based on semantic boundaries
- **FieldReportChunker**: Specialized chunking for field reports
- **TableChunker**: Extract and chunk tabular data
- **HierarchicalChunker**: Maintain document hierarchy in chunks

### 5. Integration Components

- **AnythingLLMConnector**: Connect to AnythingLLM vectorization
- **LibreChatDocumentAdapter**: Adapt documents for LibreChat
- **VectorizationQueue**: Queue system for document vectorization
- **ProcessingMonitor**: Monitor and report on processing status

## Implementation Details

### Pipeline Architecture

The document processing pipeline will follow a modular design with clearly defined stages:

1. **Document Loading**: Load documents from various sources
2. **Document Parsing**: Parse documents into a normalized format
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract metadata from documents
4. **Entity Recognition**: Identify farm-specific entities
5. **Chunking**: Split documents into appropriate chunks
6. **Vectorization**: Prepare chunks for vectorization
7. **Storage**: Store processed documents and metadata

Each stage will be implemented as a pluggable component, allowing for customization and extension.

### Metadata Extraction

The metadata extraction system will focus on agricultural-specific entities:

- Field identifiers and locations
- Crop types and varieties
- Equipment models and maintenance records
- Seasonal and weather information
- Soil composition and test results
- Treatment applications and rates

### Chunking Strategies

Chunking strategies will be optimized for agricultural content:

- Field reports will be chunked to maintain observation context
- Equipment manuals will preserve hierarchical structure
- Soil reports will maintain relationship between test results
- Images will be processed with relevant metadata as context

### AnythingLLM Integration

The pipeline will integrate with AnythingLLM's vectorization system:

- Use AnythingLLM's document storage mechanisms
- Extend the vectorization process with agricultural-specific embeddings
- Maintain compatibility with AnythingLLM's retrieval system
- Implement custom metadata indexing for farm entities

### LibreChat Integration

The pipeline will ensure compatibility with LibreChat:

- Provide document adapters for LibreChat's document tools
- Ensure proper formatting of agricultural content for chat context
- Support multi-modal content (text, images) in chat interactions
- Enable contextual retrieval based on chat history

## API Endpoints

### Document Processing API

- `POST /api/documents/process`: Submit documents for processing
- `GET /api/documents/{id}/status`: Check processing status
- `GET /api/documents/{id}/metadata`: Retrieve document metadata
- `GET /api/documents/{id}/chunks`: Retrieve document chunks

### Pipeline Management API

- `GET /api/pipeline/stages`: List available pipeline stages
- `POST /api/pipeline/configure`: Configure pipeline stages
- `GET /api/pipeline/status`: Get pipeline processing status

### Metadata API

- `GET /api/metadata/entities`: List recognized entities
- `GET /api/metadata/entities/{type}`: List entities of specific type
- `GET /api/metadata/search`: Search metadata

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each processor and pipeline stage
- Integration tests for the complete pipeline
- Performance tests for processing large agricultural documents
- Validation tests for metadata extraction accuracy
- Compatibility tests with AnythingLLM and LibreChat
