# Mobile Experience for Farm Management

## Overview

This document outlines the mobile experience for our farm management system, focusing on field usability and offline capabilities. The mobile experience is critical for agricultural users who need to access and input information while in the field, often in challenging conditions with limited connectivity.

## Design Philosophy

Our mobile experience follows these core principles:

1. **Field-First Design**: Optimize for use in agricultural settings
2. **Offline Capability**: Ensure critical functions work without connectivity
3. **Efficiency**: Minimize steps for common field tasks
4. **Durability**: Design for challenging environmental conditions
5. **Battery Conservation**: Optimize for all-day use in the field

## User Experience Considerations

### Environmental Challenges

Agricultural users face unique challenges:

- **Sunlight Readability**: Screens must be visible in bright sunlight
- **Gloved Operation**: Interface must work with gloved hands
- **Dirty/Wet Conditions**: Must function when screen or hands are not clean
- **Temperature Extremes**: Must work in cold or hot conditions
- **Limited Attention**: Users often multitasking with equipment or crops

### Field-Optimized Interface

To address these challenges, our interface will feature:

- **High Contrast Mode**: Automatically enabled in bright conditions
