# Agricultural Use Cases and Examples

## Overview

This document provides concrete examples of how the integrated features from LibreChat and AnythingLLM will be used in real-world agricultural settings. These examples illustrate the practical value of each feature and help developers understand the intended user experience and outcomes.

## Multi-Modal Support Examples

### Example 1: Crop Disease Identification

**Scenario**: A farmer notices unusual spots on soybean leaves and needs to identify the disease quickly.

**Current Process (Without Multi-Modal)**:
1. Farmer tries to describe the symptoms in text: "My soybeans have round brown spots with yellow halos, about 1/4 inch in diameter."
2. AI provides several possible diseases based on the description.
3. Farmer must compare descriptions to what they're seeing and ask follow-up questions.
4. Process may take multiple exchanges and still result in uncertainty.

**Enhanced Process (With Multi-Modal)**:
1. Farmer takes photos of affected leaves in the field.
2. Farmer uploads photos directly in the chat: "What's affecting my soybeans?"
3. AI analyzes images and responds: "These images show Frogeye Leaf Spot (Cercospora sojina) at early to moderate infection stage. The circular lesions with reddish-brown centers and yellow halos are characteristic of this disease."
4. AI provides severity assessment: "Infection appears to be at approximately 15% leaf area affected, approaching but not yet at economic threshold for treatment."
5. AI generates treatment recommendations based on the specific disease, severity, and crop stage.

**Outcome**: Faster, more accurate diagnosis leading to timely and appropriate treatment decisions, potentially saving thousands of dollars in crop value.

### Example 2: Equipment Troubleshooting

**Scenario**: A planter unit is skipping seeds during planting, causing poor stand establishment.

**Current Process (Without Multi-Modal)**:
1. Farmer describes the issue: "My planter is skipping seeds in row 6."
2. AI lists several possible causes based on the description.
3. Farmer must check each potential cause and report back.
4. Troubleshooting requires multiple exchanges and trial-and-error.

**Enhanced Process (With Multi-Modal)**:
1. Farmer takes photos and video of the planter unit in operation.
2. Farmer uploads media: "My John Deere 1775NT planter is skipping seeds in row 6. Here's video of the seed delivery and photos of the disk and vacuum system."
3. AI analyzes the visual information: "The video shows intermittent seed drops. I can see in image #2 that the seed disk has visible wear on the edge and doesn't form a proper seal with the vacuum system."
4. AI provides visual diagnosis: "The primary issue appears to be a worn seed disk (part #AA65477) that's not maintaining proper vacuum pressure. There's also visible seed dust buildup on the sensor in image #3 that may be causing false readings."
5. AI generates repair instructions with visual references and parts list.

**Outcome**: Precise diagnosis without requiring an equipment dealer visit, minimizing downtime during critical planting window.

## Conversation Management Examples

### Example 1: Crop Rotation Planning

**Scenario**: A farmer is planning next year's crop rotation for a 160-acre field with variable soil types.

**Current Process (Without Advanced Conversation Management)**:
1. Farmer starts a conversation about crop options.
2. Each option must be explored in separate conversations.
3. Comparing scenarios requires switching between conversations.
4. Previous context is lost when starting new options.
5. Final decision and rationale are difficult to document.

**Enhanced Process (With Advanced Conversation Management)**:
1. Farmer starts a conversation with field history: "I need to plan my rotation for Smith Farm (160 acres) which was in corn this year. Soil pH ranges from 6.2-7.0, organic matter 2.1-3.5%."
2. AI suggests several options based on the field history and soil conditions.
3. Farmer uses **conversation branching** to explore three scenarios from this point:
   - Branch A: Soybeans conventional
   - Branch B: Soybeans organic transition
   - Branch C: Wheat followed by double-crop soybeans
4. In each branch, the farmer explores details while maintaining the original field context.
5. Farmer can easily switch between branches to compare projections.
6. Using **context pinning**, the farmer keeps soil test results and input costs visible across all scenarios.
7. Farmer uses **conversation tagging** to mark this as "2024 Smith Farm Planning" for future reference.
8. Final decision and complete reasoning process are preserved in a single, organized conversation structure.

**Outcome**: More thorough exploration of options, better documentation of decision process, and easier reference for future planning.

### Example 2: Seasonal Pest Management

**Scenario**: A farmer is managing an evolving pest situation throughout the growing season.

**Current Process (Without Advanced Conversation Management)**:
1. Farmer has separate conversations about pest issues at different times.
2. Previous observations and treatments aren't automatically included in context.
3. Seasonal patterns are difficult to track across conversations.
4. Treatment history must be manually referenced.

**Enhanced Process (With Advanced Conversation Management)**:
1. Farmer creates a conversation tagged as "2023 Corn Pest Management."
2. Early season, farmer reports cutworm activity with photos.
3. AI provides recommendations which farmer implements.
4. Using **conversation continuity**, farmer adds new observations weeks later about corn borer emergence.
5. AI automatically includes relevant context from earlier pest management without requiring repetition.
6. Using **message editing**, farmer updates infestation levels as they change.
7. AI adjusts recommendations based on:
   - Previous treatments already applied
   - Changing pest pressure
   - Crop growth stage
   - Weather conditions
8. At season end, farmer has a complete, chronological record of the pest management story.
9. Using **conversation analytics**, farmer identifies that early-season preventative measures were most effective.

**Outcome**: More consistent pest management approach, better institutional knowledge capture, and improved strategy for future seasons.

## Artifact System Examples

### Example 1: Soil Test Interpretation

**Scenario**: A farmer receives soil test results and needs to develop a fertilizer plan.

**Current Process (Without Artifacts)**:
1. Farmer manually enters soil test values or describes results.
2. AI provides text-based recommendations.
3. Farmer must manually calculate application rates.
4. Visualizing deficiencies or comparing to optimal ranges is difficult.

**Enhanced Process (With Artifacts)**:
1. Farmer uploads soil test PDF: "Please analyze this soil test for Field 7 and recommend fertilizer applications for corn next year."
2. AI extracts data and generates multiple **interactive artifacts**:
   - **Nutrient Level Chart**: Visual representation of each nutrient relative to optimal ranges
   - **Field Nutrient Map**: If multiple samples, a visualization of nutrient variability across the field
   - **Recommendation Table**: Structured display of recommended products, rates, and timing
   - **Cost Calculator**: Interactive tool to estimate costs based on current input prices
   - **Application Map**: If variable rate is recommended, a visual prescription map
3. Farmer can interact with artifacts - adjusting target yields, input prices, or application timing and seeing results update in real-time.
4. Farmer can export artifacts for use in other systems or share with input suppliers.

**Outcome**: Clearer understanding of soil fertility status, more precise input planning, and potential cost savings through optimized application.

### Example 2: Yield Data Analysis

**Scenario**: A farmer has completed harvest and wants to analyze yield results to improve next year.

**Current Process (Without Artifacts)**:
1. Farmer describes yield results or provides basic numbers.
2. AI offers text-based analysis and general recommendations.
3. Identifying patterns requires farmer to mentally visualize data.
4. Correlating multiple factors (soil, inputs, weather) is challenging.

**Enhanced Process (With Artifacts)**:
1. Farmer uploads yield data file: "Please analyze my corn yield data from Smith Farm and help me understand what affected yields this year."
2. AI processes the data and generates multiple **interactive artifacts**:
   - **Yield Map Visualization**: Color-coded map showing yield variations across the field
   - **Zone Analysis**: Automatic identification of management zones based on yield patterns
   - **Correlation Dashboard**: Interactive visualization showing relationships between yield and factors like soil type, elevation, and inputs
   - **Weather Impact Graph**: Timeline showing weather events correlated with crop development stages
   - **ROI Calculator**: Analysis of input costs versus yield returns by zone
3. Farmer can interact with artifacts - highlighting specific areas, filtering by different factors, or adjusting analysis parameters.
4. Farmer can ask follow-up questions while referencing specific parts of the artifacts: "Why was yield lower in the northwest corner?"

**Outcome**: Deeper insights into yield-limiting factors, more targeted management plans for next season, and improved ROI through zone-specific adjustments.

## Tool Framework Examples

### Example 1: Irrigation Scheduling

**Scenario**: A farmer needs to optimize irrigation scheduling during a dry period.

**Current Process (Without Tool Framework)**:
1. Farmer describes field conditions and asks for irrigation advice.
2. AI provides general recommendations based on limited information.
3. Farmer must manually check weather forecasts and calculate water needs.
4. Recommendations don't account for specific irrigation system capabilities.

**Enhanced Process (With Tool Framework)**:
1. Farmer initiates irrigation planning: "I need to schedule irrigation for my center pivot on Field 12 soybeans for the next 10 days."
2. AI activates multiple **integrated tools**:
   - **Weather Tool**: Automatically retrieves 10-day forecast for the field's exact location
   - **Soil Moisture Calculator**: Estimates current soil moisture based on recent weather and soil type
   - **Crop Water Demand Tool**: Calculates daily crop water requirements based on growth stage and weather
   - **Irrigation System Tool**: Incorporates the specific center pivot capabilities (flow rate, rotation time)
3. AI integrates data from all tools and generates a daily irrigation schedule.
4. If weather changes, farmer can request an update, and all calculations are automatically refreshed.
5. System tracks actual irrigation applications and adjusts future recommendations accordingly.

**Outcome**: Optimized water use, reduced energy costs, and improved crop performance through precisely timed irrigation.

### Example 2: Spray Mixing Calculator

**Scenario**: A farmer needs to prepare a tank mix for fungicide application.

**Current Process (Without Tool Framework)**:
1. Farmer asks about mixing rates for specific products.
2. AI provides general mixing instructions.
3. Farmer must calculate exact quantities for their tank size.
4. Compatibility issues might not be identified.

**Enhanced Process (With Tool Framework)**:
1. Farmer initiates spray planning: "I need to mix a fungicide application for 80 acres of wheat at flag leaf stage. I have a 500-gallon sprayer."
2. AI activates multiple **integrated tools**:
   - **Product Database Tool**: Accesses up-to-date label information for available fungicides
   - **Growth Stage Tool**: Confirms appropriate products for wheat at flag leaf stage
   - **Tank Mix Calculator**: Calculates precise quantities for the 500-gallon tank
   - **Compatibility Checker**: Verifies compatibility between products
   - **Nozzle Selection Tool**: Recommends optimal nozzle type and pressure
3. AI presents a complete mixing plan with sequence, quantities, and mixing instructions.
4. Farmer can adjust parameters (e.g., "I want to add a micronutrient mix") and the plan updates automatically.
5. System generates a record of the application for compliance documentation.

**Outcome**: Accurate application rates, reduced risk of mixing errors, and proper documentation for regulatory compliance.

## Code Artifacts Examples

### Example 1: Custom Fertilizer Blend Calculator

**Scenario**: A farmer needs to create a custom fertilizer blend based on soil test results.

**Current Process (Without Code Artifacts)**:
1. Farmer shares soil test results and crop needs.
2. AI suggests general fertilizer recommendations.
3. Creating a precise custom blend requires manual calculations.
4. Optimizing for cost while meeting nutrient requirements is complex.

**Enhanced Process (With Code Artifacts)**:
1. Farmer shares soil test results: "I need a custom blend for corn on Field 5 based on these soil test results. I have access to urea, DAP, potash, and AMS."
2. AI generates a **code artifact** - an interactive fertilizer calculator:
```python
# Custom Fertilizer Blend Calculator
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Soil test values
soil_N = 15  # ppm
soil_P = 22  # ppm
soil_K = 145  # ppm
soil_S = 8   # ppm

# Crop requirements
target_N = 180  # lbs/acre
target_P = 70   # lbs/acre
target_K = 90   # lbs/acre
target_S = 20   # lbs/acre

# Available fertilizers (N-P-K-S)
fertilizers = {
    "Urea": [46, 0, 0, 0],
    "DAP": [18, 46, 0, 0],
    "Potash": [0, 0, 60, 0],
    "AMS": [21, 0, 0, 24]
}

# Current prices ($/ton)
prices = {
    "Urea": 550,
    "DAP": 650,
    "Potash": 450,
    "AMS": 400
}

# Function to calculate blend cost and nutrient delivery
def calculate_blend(rates):
    # rates in lbs/acre of each product
    urea, dap, potash, ams = rates
    
    # Calculate nutrients supplied
    N_supplied = (urea * fertilizers["Urea"][0] / 100) + \
                 (dap * fertilizers["DAP"][0] / 100) + \
                 (ams * fertilizers["AMS"][0] / 100)
    
    P_supplied = (dap * fertilizers["DAP"][1] / 100)
    
    K_supplied = (potash * fertilizers["Potash"][2] / 100)
    
    S_supplied = (ams * fertilizers["AMS"][3] / 100)
    
    # Calculate total cost
    cost = (urea * prices["Urea"] / 2000) + \
           (dap * prices["DAP"] / 2000) + \
           (potash * prices["Potash"] / 2000) + \
           (ams * prices["AMS"] / 2000)
    
    return {
        "rates": {"Urea": urea, "DAP": dap, "Potash": potash, "AMS": ams},
        "nutrients": {"N": N_supplied, "P": P_supplied, "K": K_supplied, "S": S_supplied},
        "cost": cost,
        "deficits": {
            "N": max(0, target_N - N_supplied),
            "P": max(0, target_P - P_supplied),
            "K": max(0, target_K - K_supplied),
            "S": max(0, target_S - S_supplied)
        }
    }

# Interactive calculator
def optimize_blend():
    # Optimization function
    def objective(rates):
        result = calculate_blend(rates)
        # Add penalty for nutrient deficits
        penalty = 1000 * sum(result["deficits"].values())
        return result["cost"] + penalty
    
    # Initial guess
    initial_rates = [100, 100, 100, 100]
    
    # Constraints (non-negative rates)
    bounds = [(0, None), (0, None), (0, None), (0, None)]
    
    # Optimize
    result = minimize(objective, initial_rates, method='L-BFGS-B', bounds=bounds)
    
    return calculate_blend(result.x)

# Calculate optimal blend
optimal = optimize_blend()

print("Optimal Fertilizer Blend:")
for product, rate in optimal["rates"].items():
    print(f"{product}: {rate:.1f} lbs/acre")

print("\nNutrient Delivery:")
for nutrient, amount in optimal["nutrients"].items():
    print(f"{nutrient}: {amount:.1f} lbs/acre")

print(f"\nTotal Cost: ${optimal['cost']:.2f} per acre")

# Allow for adjustments
def adjust_blend(urea_adj=0, dap_adj=0, potash_adj=0, ams_adj=0):
    rates = [
        optimal["rates"]["Urea"] + urea_adj,
        optimal["rates"]["DAP"] + dap_adj,
        optimal["rates"]["Potash"] + potash_adj,
        optimal["rates"]["AMS"] + ams_adj
    ]
    return calculate_blend(rates)
```
3. Farmer can execute the code to see the optimal blend, or modify parameters:
   - Adjust nutrient targets based on yield goals
   - Update fertilizer prices as they change
   - Add or remove available fertilizer products
   - Run what-if scenarios with different constraints
4. The code artifact can be saved and reused for future blend calculations.

**Outcome**: Cost-optimized fertilizer blend that precisely meets crop needs, with the ability to quickly adjust as prices or requirements change.

### Example 2: Growing Degree Day Calculator

**Scenario**: A farmer needs to track crop development and predict timing of key growth stages.

**Current Process (Without Code Artifacts)**:
1. Farmer asks about crop development timing.
2. AI provides general estimates based on planting date.
3. Adjusting for actual weather conditions requires manual calculations.
4. Predictions don't update as the season progresses.

**Enhanced Process (With Code Artifacts)**:
1. Farmer asks: "Can you help me track corn development and predict when we'll reach tasseling? We planted Pioneer P1197 on April 28th."
2. AI generates a **code artifact** - an interactive GDD calculator:
```python
# Growing Degree Day Calculator and Growth Stage Predictor
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import requests

# Farm location
lat = 41.85
lon = -88.31
field_name = "North 80"

# Crop information
crop = "Corn"
variety = "Pioneer P1197"
planting_date = "2023-04-28"
relative_maturity = 111  # days

# Growth stages and GDD requirements for this hybrid
growth_stages = {
    "VE": 125,     # Emergence
    "V6": 475,     # 6-leaf
    "V12": 870,    # 12-leaf
    "VT": 1350,    # Tasseling
    "R1": 1400,    # Silking
    "R4": 1925,    # Dough
    "R5": 2450,    # Dent
    "R6": 2700     # Physiological maturity
}

# Function to calculate GDD
def calculate_gdd(tmax, tmin, base=50, cap=86):
    tmax = min(tmax, cap)
    tmin = max(tmin, base)
    return max(0, (tmax + tmin) / 2 - base)

# Function to fetch weather data (historical + forecast)
def get_weather_data(lat, lon, start_date, end_date=None):
    # This would connect to a weather API in production
    # For this example, we'll simulate weather data
    if end_date is None:
        end_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    
    # Create date range
    start = datetime.strptime(start_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
    end = datetime.strptime(end_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
    dates = [(start + timedelta(days=i)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d") 
             for i in range((end - start).days + 1)]
    
    # Simulate weather data (would be API data in production)
    import numpy as np
    np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
    
    # Generate somewhat realistic temperatures for corn growing season
    base_temps = {
        4: (65, 45),  # April: (avg high, avg low)
        5: (75, 55),  # May
        6: (83, 63),  # June
        7: (88, 68),  # July
        8: (86, 66),  # August
        9: (78, 58),  # September
        10: (65, 45)  # October
    }
    
    temps = []
    for date_str in dates:
        date = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
        month = date.month
        avg_high, avg_low = base_temps.get(month, (70, 50))
        
        # Add some random variation
        high = avg_high + np.random.normal(0, 5)
        low = avg_low + np.random.normal(0, 5)
        
        temps.append({
            "date": date_str,
            "tmax": high,
            "tmin": low
        })
    
    return pd.DataFrame(temps)

# Get weather data from planting to current/end date
weather_data = get_weather_data(lat, lon, planting_date)

# Calculate GDD accumulation
weather_data["gdd"] = weather_data.apply(
    lambda row: calculate_gdd(row["tmax"], row["tmin"]), axis=1
)
weather_data["cumulative_gdd"] = weather_data["gdd"].cumsum()

# Predict growth stages
stage_dates = {}
for stage, gdd_requirement in growth_stages.items():
    if gdd_requirement <= weather_data["cumulative_gdd"].max():
        # Find the first date where cumulative GDD exceeds the requirement
        stage_date = weather_data[weather_data["cumulative_gdd"] >= gdd_requirement].iloc[0]["date"]
        stage_dates[stage] = stage_date
    else:
        # Extrapolate based on recent GDD accumulation rate
        recent_gdd_rate = weather_data["gdd"].tail(14).mean()
        remaining_gdd = gdd_requirement - weather_data["cumulative_gdd"].max()
        days_to_stage = remaining_gdd / recent_gdd_rate
        last_date = datetime.strptime(weather_data.iloc[-1]["date"], "%Y-%m-%d")
        predicted_date = last_date + timedelta(days=int(days_to_stage))
        stage_dates[stage] = predicted_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") + " (predicted)"

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(range(len(weather_data)), weather_data["cumulative_gdd"], 'b-')

# Add growth stage markers
for stage, gdd_req in growth_stages.items():
    if gdd_req <= weather_data["cumulative_gdd"].max():
        idx = weather_data[weather_data["cumulative_gdd"] >= gdd_req].index[0]
        plt.axhline(y=gdd_req, color='r', linestyle='--', alpha=0.3)
        plt.plot(idx, gdd_req, 'ro')
        plt.text(idx, gdd_req + 50, stage, fontsize=9)

plt.title(f"{crop} ({variety}) GDD Accumulation - {field_name}")
plt.xlabel("Days After Planting")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Growing Degree Days")
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Display results
print(f"Crop: {crop} ({variety})")
print(f"Planting Date: {planting_date}")
print(f"Current GDD Accumulation: {weather_data['cumulative_gdd'].max():.0f}")
print("\nGrowth Stage Dates:")
for stage, date in stage_dates.items():
    print(f"{stage}: {date}")

# Function to update with new weather data
def update_predictions(new_weather_data=None):
    # This would fetch the latest weather in production
    # For demo, we'll just return the current predictions
    return stage_dates
```
3. Farmer can execute the code to see current GDD accumulation and predicted dates for each growth stage.
4. As the season progresses, the farmer can update the calculator with actual weather data to refine predictions.
5. The code can be modified to add alerts for upcoming growth stages or to compare multiple varieties.

**Outcome**: More accurate timing of field operations based on actual crop development rather than calendar dates, leading to optimized input applications and improved crop management.
