- Document API endpoints and data structures
- Create specific documentation for integration points
- Follow the BP (BizzyPerson) and BF (BizzyFarmer) documentation naming conventions

### Documentation Naming Convention
- Maintain core overview documents with original numbering (bp00-bp07)
- For specialized documents, use category prefixes with double dash:
  * `bp-int--` for integration documents (e.g., `bp-int--knowledge-base-integration.md`)
  * `bp-core--` for core platform documents
  * `bp-ui--` for UI-related documents
  * `bp-tech--` for technical documents
  * `bp-ext--` for extension-related documents
  * `bp-pm--` for project management documents
- Keep BF (BizzyFarmer) files with their existing naming convention
- Use descriptive names after the prefix for clarity
- Avoid using numbers in the new naming convention to prevent conflicts

## Development Process
- Start with an integration analysis to identify AnythingLLM and LibreChat touch points
- Create an integration plan before implementing any features
- Document dependencies and version requirements for both systems
- Implement features in the order specified in the project checklist
- Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
- Ensure mobile compatibility for field-focused features
- Optimize for performance and offline capabilities where appropriate
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing AnythingLLM and LibreChat features
- Regularly test with both base systems during development
- Document any conflicts or compatibility issues between the systems

## Unified UI Integration
- Use AnythingLLM's UI as the primary interface
- Embed LibreChat's capabilities within AnythingLLM's UI
- Maintain consistent styling and interaction patterns
- Implement a shared state management system
- Create a unified authentication system
- Ensure seamless navigation between features
- Follow the guidelines in bp08-Unified-UI-Integration.md

## Data Capture & Retrieval Excellence
- Optimize vectorization specifically for industry-specific terminology and observations
- Implement robust tagging systems that understand domain-specific entities
- Enhance semantic search to recognize relationships between industry concepts
- Create specialized embedding approaches for different types of data
- Implement thorough validation for all captured data to ensure quality
- Design multi-modal capture methods (voice, image, text) optimized for field use
- Ensure retrieval systems provide context-aware results
- Benchmark retrieval accuracy against real-world scenarios

## Task Completion Protocol
- When a development task is completed, provide a brief, standardized green task completion summary
- Keep summaries concise and to the point - focus on key outcomes only
- Include: what was accomplished, critical challenges overcome, and essential next steps
- Limit to 3-8 check mark bullet points when possible
- Format consistently for easy scanning and reference
- Provide a copy-paste ready version for new chat contexts
- Update both bp00-Project-Checklist.md and bp04-Project-Checklist.md

When task is completed, besides the protocols, ask only the most important next step as a question!!

## Technical Discussion Protocol
- Before implementing any checklist item, conduct a focused technical discussion
- Document key decisions and their rationale in a standardized format
- For each component, address:
  * Integration approach with AnythingLLM
  * Technology selection and compatibility concerns
  * Data flow and state management
  * Mobile/field usability considerations
