# AnythingLLM Farm Management Extension

An agricultural knowledge management system built as an extension for AnythingLLM, focusing on farm operations, field observations, and agricultural decision support.

## What is AnythingLLM?

AnythingLLM is an open-source, locally hosted document chatbot that enables you to chat with your documents, websites, and other data sources using various LLM providers. It offers a user-friendly interface for document management, vector search, and conversational AI capabilities. This project extends AnythingLLM's core functionality with specialized features for agricultural applications.

## Project Overview

This extension enhances AnythingLLM with specialized features for agricultural use:
- Field observation management
- Agricultural knowledge processing
- Mobile-first field interface
- Offline-capable operations
- Specialized agricultural AI agents

## Agricultural Features

The farm management extension adds several specialized capabilities to AnythingLLM:

- **Field Notes System**: Structured data capture for farm observations with location tagging
- **Agricultural Knowledge Base**: Pre-configured vectorization for farming documents and resources
- **Field-Optimized Mobile UI**: Touch-friendly interfaces designed for outdoor use
- **Offline Synchronization**: Capture data in the field without connectivity
- **Farm-Specific AI Agents**: Specialized models trained on agricultural terminology and practices
- **Equipment Management**: Track maintenance, usage, and specifications
- **Soil Test Integration**: Import and analyze soil test results with visualization
- **Weather Data Correlation**: Connect observations with weather conditions

## Climate FieldView Integration

A key feature of this extension is comprehensive integration with Climate FieldView:

- **Field Boundary Synchronization**: Import and manage field boundaries from FieldView
- **Application Records**: Access fertilizer, chemical, and seed application data
- **Harvest Data**: Import yield maps and harvest records for analysis
- **NDVI Imagery**: Utilize vegetation index imagery for field monitoring
- **Equipment Operations**: Track equipment usage and field operations

The Climate FieldView integration enables:

- **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Combine FieldView data with observations for deeper insights
- **Unified Data View**: Access all farm data through a single interface
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Generate recommendations based on comprehensive data
- **Historical Context**: Maintain complete field history for better decisions
- **Predictive Capabilities**: Forecast outcomes based on historical patterns

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Architecture

This extension implements a powerful Model Context Protocol architecture:

- **MCP Servers**: Specialized processors for agricultural data sources
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Agricultural-specific algorithms for data analysis
- **Custom Agent Development**: Framework for creating specialized farm agents
- **Integration Flexibility**: Connect multiple agricultural data sources
- **Extensible Design**: Farmers can develop custom processors for unique needs

## Integration with AnythingLLM

This extension follows AnythingLLM's architecture and design patterns:
- Extends the existing UI components while maintaining consistent styling
- Integrates with AnythingLLM's data model and vectorization system
- Adds agriculture-specific endpoints to the API
- Leverages the existing state management approach
- Implements responsive design compatible with AnythingLLM's mobile interface

The farm management features are built as modular components that integrate with:
- AnythingLLM's sidebar navigation
- Workspace management system
- Document embedding and vectorization
- Chat interface and context handling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository with AnythingLLM submodule:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/deachne/AnythingLLM-farm-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies for both AnythingLLM and the farm extension:
```bash
# Install AnythingLLM dependencies
cd anything-llm
npm install

# Install farm extension dependencies
cd ..
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Development Status

Currently in initial development phase. See `00-Project-Checklist.md` for current progress and upcoming tasks.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a comprehensive agricultural knowledge management system that:

- **Simplifies Data Collection**: Capture field observations, soil tests, and equipment records with minimal effort
- **Enhances Decision Making**: Provide AI-powered insights based on comprehensive farm data
- **Integrates Key Data Sources**: Connect with Climate FieldView and other agricultural platforms
- **Works in Field Conditions**: Function effectively in rural environments with limited connectivity
- **Grows with the Farm**: Scale from basic observation tracking to comprehensive farm management
- **Empowers Customization**: Allow advanced users to create specialized agents and processors

By combining AnythingLLM's powerful document processing with agricultural-specific features and third-party integrations, we're creating a system that transforms how farmers capture, organize, and leverage their knowledge.
