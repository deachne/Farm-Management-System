# BP-INT-04: Knowledge Base Integration - Task Completion

## Task Completion Summary

✅ Successfully implemented the knowledge base integration between AnythingLLM and LibreChat
✅ Created a layered architecture with shared core, AnythingLLM integration, and LibreChat integration
✅ Implemented document synchronization between AnythingLLM and LibreChat RAG
✅ Added API endpoints for querying the knowledge base from both systems
✅ Created UI integration components for AnythingLLM workspace
✅ Implemented LibreChat RAG plugin for AnythingLLM integration
✅ Documented the integration architecture and API

## Implementation Details

The knowledge base integration connects AnythingLLM's vector store with LibreChat's RAG capabilities, providing a unified interface for accessing and querying knowledge across both systems. This integration enables seamless knowledge sharing between the document management capabilities of AnythingLLM and the advanced chat features of LibreChat.

### Key Components

1. **Shared Knowledge Base** (`bizzy/core/shared/knowledge-base/index.js`)
   - Core integration layer that provides a unified interface
   - Handles communication between AnythingLLM and LibreChat
   - Manages document synchronization and querying

2. **AnythingLLM Integration** (`bizzy/core/anythingllm/knowledge-base-integration.js`)
   - Extends AnythingLLM's vector search with LibreChat RAG capabilities
   - Adds UI components for LibreChat integration
   - Manages synchronization of workspaces with LibreChat

3. **LibreChat Integration** (`bizzy/core/librechat/knowledge-base-integration.js`)
   - Provides a RAG plugin for LibreChat to access AnythingLLM's vector store
   - Handles RAG queries and document synchronization
   - Creates LibreChat tools for AnythingLLM integration

## Next Steps

The next logical step is to implement the chat integration with LibreChat capabilities (BP-INT-05), which will build on the knowledge base integration to provide a unified chat experience across both systems.
