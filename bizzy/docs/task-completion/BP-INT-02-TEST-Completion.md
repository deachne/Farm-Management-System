- Error handling for various scenarios

### Testing Setup

Implemented a complete testing environment with:

- Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`)
- Test setup file with environment variables (`jest.setup.js`)
- Mock implementations for dependencies
- Automated test script (`run-tests.sh`)
- Package.json with test dependencies

### Documentation

- Updated the README with detailed testing instructions
