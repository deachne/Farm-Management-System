# Farm Management Cycle: Current Operations & Tracking

## Winter Planning Phase (January-March)

### Financial Review & Analysis
- Review actual expenses from previous season across all 20 fields (5,000 acres)
- Compare actual vs. projected costs and yields
- Analyze ROI by field, crop type, and input program
- Store and reference this data primarily in spreadsheets

### Crop Planning
- Evaluate previous year's crop locations to plan rotation
- Create crop plan using Excel spreadsheets
- Project expenses for seed, fertilizer, chemicals, operations
- Incorporate current market prices and projections
- Plan on whole-farm and individual field levels

### Soil Analysis
- Review soil test results for each field
- Apply different calculation formulas (regenerative or standard)
- Determine nutrient requirements for planned crops
- Calculate total fertilizer needs for entire operation

### Input Sourcing
- Request fertilizer quotes from multiple retailers based on calculated needs
- Source and price chemical inputs
- Compare supplier pricing for major inputs
- Manually track these prices in spreadsheets or notes

### Education & Research
- Attend winter meetings and educational sessions
- Watch instructional videos and webinars
- Research improved growing methods and new technologies
- Take notes on potential practices to implement
- Document findings in various formats (paper, digital notes)

### Equipment Preparation
- Create maintenance schedules for all machinery
- Compile parts lists and maintenance supplies
- Plan equipment upgrades or modifications
- Document maintenance history and requirements

## Spring Operations (April-May)

### Field Preparation
- Conduct field inspections as snow melts
- Document drainage issues, residue cover, soil conditions
- Note areas needing attention (stone picking, drainage improvements)
- Check soil moisture and temperature to determine field readiness

### Fertility Planning
- Calculate specific tank configurations for air seeder
- Optimize fertilizer blends for tank capacity and efficiency
- Maximize acres per fill based on tank sizes and application rates
- Currently done mostly on paper or basic spreadsheets

### Field Mapping
- Use Climate FieldView to create fertility management zones
- Design and document on-farm trial layouts
- Map field boundaries and management zones
- Track this information across multiple systems

### Seeding Operations
- Record seeding dates, rates, and conditions
- Document input applications and any issues
- Log equipment settings and performance
- Track seeding progress and field status

## Growing Season (June-August)

### Field Scouting
- Conduct 5-6 scheduled scouting trips throughout the season
- Document growth stages, crop conditions, stand counts
- Monitor weed, disease, and insect pressure
- Record observations via notes, photos, or Climate FieldView

### Soil & Tissue Testing
- Collect and submit soil samples for biological testing
- Measure soil EC levels and compaction during key periods
- Perform tissue testing at critical growth stages
- Submit samples and maintain records of results

### Crop Monitoring
- Assess crop development and health
- Calculate yield potential based on observations
- Track overall crop progress and condition
- Document weather impacts and anomalies

### Trial Assessment
- Monitor test plots and experimental treatments
- Document visible differences between treatments
- Record observations on trial performance
- Compare trial areas to standard practices

## Harvest & Post-Harvest (September-December)

### Yield Tracking
- Monitor yields through Climate FieldView
- Pay special attention to trial area performance
- Document yield and quality factors by field
- Compare actual vs. projected yields

### Grain Management
- Track grain storage by bin, including quantity and quality
- Record grain movement through bills of lading
- Document trucking logistics and deliveries
- Manage inventory and delivery commitments

### Post-Harvest Field Work
- Document fall tillage, fertilizer applications
- Track fall field conditions and moisture
- Conduct post-harvest soil sampling
- Record grain testing results (protein, quality)

### Analytics & Planning
- Compare yield results against input programs
- Calculate ROI by field, crop, and practice
- Analyze trial results and performance
- Begin preliminary planning for next season

## Year-Round Activities

### Daily Observations
- Record weather conditions and extremes
- Document wildlife sightings and natural phenomena
- Note field-specific observations during drive-bys
- Currently log these in various places (notebooks, phone notes)

### Equipment Tracking
- Monitor equipment performance and issues
- Document repairs and maintenance performed
- Track operating hours and fuel consumption
- Keep service records and parts replacement information

### Marketing Activities
- Track grain inventory available for sale
- Record marketing contracts and pricing
- Document delivery schedules and commitments
- Manage grain quality specifications and segregation

### General Farm Journaling
- Record daily activities and operations
- Document employee work and scheduling
- Note any unusual occurrences or observations
- Currently scattered across multiple systems (paper, digital notes, calendars)

## Current Tracking Systems Used

- Excel spreadsheets for crop planning and financial tracking
- Climate FieldView for mapping and yield data
- Paper notes for daily observations and quick logging
- Digital notes (phone apps) for field observations
- Software systems for accounting and payroll
- Paper files for soil test results and recommendations
- Email archives for quotes and contracts
- Physical journals and calendars for scheduling
- Farm record books for historical data

The current approach requires significant manual data transfer between systems, creates information silos, and often leaves valuable observations disconnected from related data points. Much of the analysis requires manually compiling information from multiple sources.
