# BizzyPerson Integration Architecture

## Overview

BizzyPerson integrates AnythingLLM and LibreChat to create a powerful knowledge management platform with extensible industry-specific capabilities. This document outlines the architecture of this integration.

## Core Components

### AnythingLLM Integration

AnythingLLM provides the following capabilities:
- Document processing and vectorization
- Knowledge base management
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Document search and retrieval

### LibreChat Integration

LibreChat provides the following capabilities:
- Multi-modal chat interface
- Tool framework for AI agents
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) client
- Artifact system for rich responses

## Integration Layer

The integration layer connects these systems through:

1. **Unified Authentication**
   - Single sign-on across both systems
   - Synchronized user management
   - Role-based access control

2. **Shared Document Processing**
   - Document ingestion through AnythingLLM
   - Document retrieval for LibreChat context
   - Unified document storage and management

3. **Knowledge Base Integration**
   - AnythingLLM vectorstore accessible to LibreChat
   - Context augmentation for chat responses
   - Knowledge base management through unified interface

4. **Chat Integration**
   - LibreChat interface with AnythingLLM knowledge
   - Tool integration for document operations
   - Artifact rendering for document visualization

## Extension Framework

The extension framework allows industry-specific modules to:
- Add custom document processors
- Implement specialized tools and agents
- Create industry-specific UI components
- Define domain-specific knowledge templates

## Data Flow

1. **Document Processing Flow**
   ```
   Document Upload → AnythingLLM Processing → Vectorization → 
   Knowledge Base Storage → Retrieval during Chat
   ```

2. **Chat Interaction Flow**
   ```
   User Query → LibreChat Processing → AnythingLLM Context Retrieval → 
   Response Generation → Artifact Rendering → User Display
   ```

3. **Extension Integration Flow**
   ```
   Extension Loading → Registration with Core → 
   Feature Availability → UI Integration
   ```
